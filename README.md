# EToH Kit v6 Documentation

This repository is used to host the documentation website for EToH Kit v6.

## Kit Download

The kit can be obtained by:

* Opening the [uncopylocked template place](https://www.roblox.com/games/104814418357350) on Roblox **(recommended)**
* Downloading the .rbxl file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/etohgame/kit/releases)

## Documentation Setup

To run the documentation site locally, make sure you have [Rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit), [Lune](https://github.com/lune-org/lune) and [Moonwave](https://github.com/evaera/moonwave) installed.

Clone this repository, download a copy of the kit place to the repository's folder, and rename the file to `place.rbxl`. Extract the scripts from the place by running the command `lune run scripts/extract-scripts`. You can then view the website by running the command `moonwave dev --code mirror`
