# Trip Parts

Trip Parts will trip the player when touched by making them sit down.
Unlike [Seats](seats.md), Trip Parts won't weld the player to them, which allows the player to be moved around freely while sitting.

## Use Cases

Trip Parts can be used to make the player forcefully sit down, useful when making things such as slides.
Under specific setups, Trip Parts can be used to do high jumps without needing the player to hug a wall.
