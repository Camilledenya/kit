# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation page for Version 6 of the EToH Tower Building Kit! This site will tell you everything that you should know about the kit; including setup instructions, detailed documentation, and more!

## Installation Instructions

The kit is distributed using a pre-made place, making it simple and straight-forward to get started. It can be obtained by:

* Opening the [uncopylocked template place](https://www.roblox.com/games/104814418357350) on Roblox **(recommended)**
* Downloading the .rbxl file from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/etohgame/kit/releases)

## Update Instructions

If you are using a previous version of a kit then you can update it to the latest version by going to our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/etohgame/kit/releases) and finding the update kit associated with the latest release. Instructions are included in the release and inside of the update kits.

Please note that there is currently no update kit from V5.5 to V6, this will be worked on soon.

## Website Navigation

The website can be navigated by using the navigation bars on the top side and left side of the site. The top bar is used to switch between different sections of the website, and the left bar is used to navigate through categories within these sections.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for each Client Object in the kit can be found in the Client Objects category. These pages will contain a list of possible configurations for the Client Object, as well as additional info such as a description of the object and potential use cases.

### Global Configuration Documentation

The Global Configurations category contains documentation for special configuration sets that nearly all Client Objects in the kit have. These are listed seperately for convenience.

### API Documentation

Documentation for the kit's scripts can be found in the API section found in the top bar. These are meant to assist people that are working on custom scripts for the kit.

See [the docs on writing repository scripts](misc.md#writing--editing-repository-scripts) for more information. Please note that you are **not allowed** to use custom scripts unless you have the Verified Builder role or are in a collaboration with someone who has the role.

## What's different compared to Version 5?

If you are experienced with building towers using an old kit, please read through [the changelog](https://etohgame.github.io/kit/changelog) as it contains important information. A guide on converting towers made using v5.5 to v6 will be written at a later date.
